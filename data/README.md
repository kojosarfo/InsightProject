The datasets used for this project are three-fold: the first is a record of several million rows of pedestrian and cyclist traffic data collected at 1 to 2-minute intervals from May to August at 14 intersections in Downtown Toronto -- this dataset is not included here because of its size; the second dataset comprises weather data for Downtown Toronto collected for the same period of May to August; and the third details the GPS co-ordinates for the intersections for which data was collected.
